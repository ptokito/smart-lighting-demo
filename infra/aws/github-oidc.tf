# =============================================================================
# Lets GitHub Actions deploy to the instances WITHOUT stored AWS keys.
#
# GitHub issues each workflow run a short-lived OpenID Connect (OIDC) token.
# AWS trusts tokens from GitHub's identity provider, but only for this
# repository's main branch, and exchanges them for temporary credentials for
# the role below. That role can do one thing: send Run Command to the two
# instances and read the result.
# =============================================================================

# Only one GitHub OIDC provider can exist per AWS account. If an earlier lab
# created it, set create_github_oidc_provider = false and it is looked up.
